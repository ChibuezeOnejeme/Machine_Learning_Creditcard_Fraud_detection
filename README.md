# Building Machine Learning Pipelines for Credit Card Fraud Detection 

This  Credit Card Fraud Detection Project includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. So, this system is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. The aim of this project is to detect 100% of fraudulent transactions while minimizing incorrect fraud classifications.
